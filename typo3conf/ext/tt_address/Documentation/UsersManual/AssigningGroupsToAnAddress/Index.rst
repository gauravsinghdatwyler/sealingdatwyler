Assigning groups to an address record
-------------------------------------

Adding groups to an address is as easy as adding a parent group to another group. Open the address
record you want to assign a group to or create a new address record, go to the category tab and
add one or more groups by checking the corresponding checkbox of the group. You can choose
multiple groups
